# The DotFiles

So we will have a collections of configs in this repo for: powershell, neovim and vscode
Things you might find here are my neovim config, ps functions for easy jumping to project folders and keybinds/plugins that I use in vs code

### Getting Started

open up a Admin Powershell window and run the following 
```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Force
```
